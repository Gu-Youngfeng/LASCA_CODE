This repository includes the source code of the paper:
**LASCA: A Large-scale Stable Customer Segmentation Approach to Credit Risk Assessment**.

# Introduction.

LASCA is a stable large-scale customer segmentation approach.
It takes a set of continuous values as input and generates *stable* segmentation solutions (split points) to effectively divide the values into distinct groups. 
A stable solution ensures that certain event rates, such as monotonicity, distribution, and retention rate, remain consistent and stable across different time periods.
