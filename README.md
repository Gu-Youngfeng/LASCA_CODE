# LASCA ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-1.0-blue)


The implementation for the paper "LASCA: A Large-Scale Stable Customer Segmentation Approach to Credit Risk Assessment".

## Setup

Create the running environment with conda `23.5.2` with Python `3.7.16`: 

```shell
conda create -n lasca python==3.7.16
conda activate lasca
```

Install the requirements for running LASCA: 

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Real-world user datasets
Due to the inclusion of a significant amount of personal privacy and commercially sensitive information in the datasets, the contents of real-world datasets are not publicly disclosed in this paper. 

To simulate a real-world dataset, we provide mock user data in the data/demo directory. This includes two CSV files: `df1_demo.csv` and `df2_demo.csv`.
**df1_demo.csv** is the pre-binning result (100 pre-bins over 3 months) and **df2_demo.csv** is user data (5000 users' score over 8 months).
These two csv file are generated by random, serving as the input user data for LASCA.

## Run LASCA

Run the phase 1 of LASCA: high quality dataset construction (HDC). This phase take user dataset as input and output the solutions dataset for data-driven optimization

```shell script
python experiments.py run_hdc

```

Run the phase 2 of LASCA: reliable data-driven optimization (RDO). This phase take the collected solutions dataset as input and output the optimized binning solutions.

```shell script
python experiments.py run_rdo

```

Notes for the project structure:
- The files in the folder `core` are the main components of the algorithms.
- The files in the folder `utils` are some useful functions for the implementation of LASCA.
- The files in the folder `data` are the user datasets of each task. Since the three real-world user datasets classified, a demo user dataset is provided.
